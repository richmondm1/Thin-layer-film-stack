*.txt files contain spectral refractive index data.ARC*.py files contain anti-reflection coating programs.NDF*.py files contain gold film/neutral density filter programs.DBR*.py files contain dielectric mirror programs.All programs run without user input except the DBR programs. However, on running the DBR programs, example user inputs are suggested at each prompt to enable the easy modelling of an 8-period Ta2O5/MgF2 DBR in Air on BK7.RI.py is simply a demonstration of refractive index data interpolation.
